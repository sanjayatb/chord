# A-secure-distributed-storage-based-on-Chord

In this project, I have implemented Chord the paper describing the Chord protocol, algorithms, and implementation, which is available at the following URL:
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/papers/2003/chord-ton.pdfLinks to an external site.

Chord uses local information and communicates with other peers to find the host (IP address and port) that a given key is mapped to. Applications may then be built on top of this service that Chord provides. In this project, I have implemented a secured simple distributed storage system for storing text files on top of Chord.
